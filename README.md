# Description:
This project aims to create a visualization tool for earthquake data and utilizes the USGS API to fetch real-time earthquake data. Ensure a stable internet connection for data retrieval. The tool will allow users to visualize earthquake occurrences around the world, providing insights into the frequency, magnitude, and location of seismic events.

# Part 1: Earthquake Visualization
In this part of the project, we develop the core functionality of the earthquake visualization tool using HTML and JavaScript. The visualization will display earthquake data on an interactive map, allowing users to explore different regions and timeframes.

# Files Included:

1) index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
2) style.css: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) file for styling the webpage.
3) script.js: JavaScript file containing the logic for fetching earthquake data and rendering it on the map.
